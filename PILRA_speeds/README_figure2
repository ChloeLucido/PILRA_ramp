This directory contains 3 files used to generate figure 2:

- pilra_speeds.txt contains the relative codon adaptiveness of each codon used in PILRA wildtype (all four isoforms are included). 
- pilra_mutant_speeds.txt contains the relative codon adaptiveness of each codon used in PILRA mutant (rs2405442).

Both of these files were generated from ExtRamp using the option to output the relative codon adaptiveness to a file (-p).

- figure2.py is a python program that generates figure 2 using the data.

REQUIREMENTS: 
figure2.py can be ran using Python version 3 in a Linux environment, or from the
original colab notebook at https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Takwim6IDOUFHBlr_4o_8hkKJkmA8kPQ

Python libraries:
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. matplotlib.pyplot

If any of those libraries is not currently in your Python Path, use the following command:
pip3 install --user [library_name]
to install the library to your path.
